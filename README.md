# My First Python Project

## Project Overview
This is my first project using Python, where I explored essential programming concepts like data structures, control flow, and logical operations. The project helped me understand the core principles of Python and programming in general.

‚ö° Developed in Udemy, "The Complete Python 3 Course: Beginner to Advanced!"


## Key Concepts Learned

### 1. Data Structures
I learned how to use Python's built-in data structures:

### 2. Control Flow
Understanding control flow was crucial for writing effective Python programs. I practiced:
- **If-else statements:** For decision making.
- **For loops:** To iterate over sequences.
- **While loops:** For repeated execution based on a condition.

### 3. Logical Operations
Logical operations are the backbone of decision-making in Python:
- **Boolean logic:** Using `and`, `or`, and `not`.
- **Comparison operators:** Such as `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`.

## Project Details
### Objective
To create a simple command-line application that demonstrates the use of data structures, control flows, and logical operations.

### Features
- User input handling.
- Data manipulation using lists and dictionaries.
- Decision making based on user input.
- Looping through data to perform repetitive tasks.

```python
# Simple program to manage a list of tasks

## Lessons Learned
- The importance of clear, structured code.
- How to handle user input and display outputs effectively.
- Using loops and conditions to manage program flow.

## Conclusion
This project was a foundational experience in Python programming, 
solidifying my understanding of basic programming constructs. 
It sets the stage for more complex projects in the future.
